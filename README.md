## Functionalities
* When you arrive for the first time, you’ll be greeted with an initial start HTML page and very little else you can customize your own code.
* As you type into one of the editor “panels”, you and anyone watching your bin will see the output being generated in real-time in the output panel. 
* The editor is compatible with every major web browser without installing any program, extension or plugin.
